Australian Fire Danger Ratings Card For Home Assistant - Under Construction! 

I've whipped up a Victorian Fire Danger Rating card for anyone that does! It's the card up the top right of the attached screenshot.. Anyway, it annoyed me that NSW has FDR's supported out of the box and there was zip, nadda, nothing for Victoria, so, I made my own.  ðŸ™‚ If there is enough interest, I will look into making this a public addon card through HACS.. 

Anyway, to get this running, you'll need the BOM integration installed (https://github.com/bremor/bureau_of_meteorology) and set to your location. Once your home location is set correctly, the BOM integration will make entities called:
"sensor.YOURLOCATION_fire_danger_0" 
"sensor.YOURLOCATION_fire_danger_1"
"sensor.YOURLOCATION_fire_danger_2"
"sensor.YOURLOCATION_fire_danger_3"
"sensor.YOURLOCATION_fire_danger_4"
and
"sensor.YOURLOCATION_fire_danger_5"

To use these entities (if you have BOM installed already, you should have these) you just need to copy and past the code below into a new "manual card" (add new card/right down the bottom), editing your location/sensor name and save the images in your HA www directory.

The FDR images need to be saved (and as stated, saved into your HA www folder):

none.png
moderate.png
high.png
extreme.png
catastrophic.png

Step by step once you have BOM and the attached images saved:

Create a new "manual card" (add new card/right down the bottom) on your dashboard

Click this link (don't copy the code from this post): https://gist.github.com/.../fa6273ef3b45a6dbefcd8fa96da26... and copy & paste the code into the card you just created.

Don't forget to change every instace of "YOURLOCATION" to your location/sensor name...
Hit save and then done on your dashboard and it should now work. I hope. lol
